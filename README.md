# Soccer-match-prediction
Random forest classification algorithm to predict the result of a match.
The best accuracy score I've gotten is 0.56, this low score could be due to the fact that a soccer game is a very random scenario to predict,
or to the fact that from the features I chose, there was a lot of missing data which I'm trying to predict with a decision tree regressor, this
part is still on the works, and I might change it to another type of algorithm.
